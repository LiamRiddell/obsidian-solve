## Obsidian Solve

![GitHub release (latest SemVer)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/LiamRiddell/obsidian-solve?style=for-the-badge&sort=semver)

An unobtrusive Obsidian plugin that quietly processes equations and patterns in real time, inspired by [NoteMaster's Smart Mode](https://github.com/LiamRiddell/NoteMaster#introducing-smart-mode). With solid engineering at its core, Solve enhances note-taking without relying on ChatGPT. For instance, effortlessly calculates date expressions (e.g., 'Now + 20 days'), performs arithmetic (e.g., '10 + 5'), and more features are coming soon.

### Arithmetic Brilliance 💡

Unveil the magic of arithmetic with Solve, where simplicity meets precision. Brace yourself for seamless calculations that redefine your note-taking.

| You Express        | Solve Delivers |
| ------------------ | -------------- |
| 10 + 20 / 200 \* 4 | 10.40          |
| 50 / 2             | 25.00          |
| 50 divide by 2     | 25.00          |

### Dynamic Date Mastery 📅
