/**
 * The built-in error-code catalog — one typed const object per domain,
 * unioned together here for autocomplete/exhaustiveness in core engine
 * code. Deliberately NOT one central enum: `IEnginePackage` is documented
 * public SDK surface for third-party packages (see `api/PackageRegistry.ts`),
 * and a closed enum would block an external package author from defining
 * their own codes without editing this file. `EngineError.code`'s runtime
 * type stays `string` for exactly that reason — this catalog is for the
 * codes THIS repo owns and wants collision/typo checking on (see
 * `__tests__/errors/ErrorCodeCatalog.spec.ts`), not a hard runtime
 * whitelist.
 *
 * As each package migrates to `Result<void, EngineError>` (see this
 * session's error-handling-refactor plan, Phase 5), it should export its
 * own small `XxxErrorCodes` const object co-located with its parselets —
 * exactly like `CoreErrorCodes` below, just scoped to one domain — and get
 * unioned into `ErrorCode` here. Until a package migrates, its existing
 * free-string codes keep working (ErrorFactory accepts any string); they
 * just aren't caught by the catalog's uniqueness/orphan checks yet.
 */

/**
 * Codes used directly by the parser/VM/engine/errors layers themselves —
 * confirmed against the current source, not aspirational. Grouped by
 * pipeline stage via the comments, not a naming prefix (these predate any
 * naming convention and renaming them is out of scope for introducing the
 * catalog — only NEW codes need to follow a scoped/prefixed style, see
 * `STACK_UNDERFLOW` etc. below).
